# Creating a Unity .gitignore File (2025-05-11 00:06Z)

_**User**_

can we make a decent git ingore file - im new to unity projects and dont know what should typically be included

---

_**Assistant**_

Absolutely! For Unity projects, having a proper `.gitignore` is crucial to avoid committing unnecessary or auto-generated files. Here’s a typical Unity `.gitignore` that covers most use cases:

```
# Unity generated folders
[Ll]ibrary/
[Tt]emp/
[Oo]bj/
[Bb]uild/
[Bb]uilds/
[Ll]ogs/
[Mm]emoryCaptures/

# Asset meta data should only be ignored when the corresponding asset is also ignored
!/[Aa]ssets/**/*.meta

# Uncomment this line if you wish to ignore the asset store tools plugin
# [Aa]ssets/AssetStoreTools*

# Autogenerated VS/JetBrains Rider/VSCode project files
*.csproj
*.unityproj
*.sln
*.suo
*.tmp
*.user
*.userprefs
*.pidb
*.booproj
*.svd
*.pdb
*.opendb
*.VC.db
*.pidb.meta

# Unity3D generated file on crash reports
sysinfo.txt

# Builds
*.apk
*.aab
*.unitypackage

# Crashlytics generated files
crashlytics-build.properties

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db

# Rider
.idea/
*.sln.iml

# Visual Studio Code
.vscode/
.history/
```

Would you like me to create this `.gitignore` file in your project root?

yes please help fix I have like 1000s of files going into the repo including loads of artifacts

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a proper `.gitignore` file for your Unity project. First, let me check if there's an existing `.gitignore` file and then create/update it appropriately.

| `undefined` |

</details>

I see there's already a `.gitignore` file in your project. Let me check its contents to see what needs to be updated.

Read file: .gitignore

I see the current `.gitignore` file has most of the essential patterns, but let's enhance it to be more comprehensive and ensure it catches all Unity-specific artifacts. I'll update it with additional patterns that are commonly needed:
