# Level Design Implementation Assistance (2025-05-11 20:18:45)

_**User**_

can you help me implement this plan? working on level01 at the moment

‚úÖ Suggestions for Your Level Design & Brush Tool
üéØ 1. Set Level Boundaries & Scale Wisely
Your level looks huge and open ‚Äî nothing wrong with that, but here‚Äôs why it may feel chaotic:

‚úÖ Recommendations:
Level Bounds:

For a first level, aim for around 50x30 Unity units (or slightly taller if it's vertical scrolling).

Add a ‚ÄúBounds‚Äù GameObject or invisible walls so the player isn‚Äôt confused about where the level ends.

Camera Limits:

Use a camera follow script with clamping so the player doesn‚Äôt fly into void space:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public Vector2 minCamPos;
public Vector2 maxCamPos;

void LateUpdate() {
    Vector3 clamped = transform.position;
    clamped.x = Mathf.Clamp(clamped.x, minCamPos.x, maxCamPos.x);
    clamped.y = Mathf.Clamp(clamped.y, minCamPos.y, maxCamPos.y);
    cam.transform.position = new Vector3(clamped.x, clamped.y, cam.transform.position.z);
}
üñåÔ∏è 2. Make a Bigger Brush
You can improve your editor tool with drag-to-paint or place multiple blocks at once.

Option: Paint a block grid like this:
Update your brush script to support ‚Äúwidth‚Äù and ‚Äúheight‚Äù:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public int brushWidth = 1;
public int brushHeight = 1;

private void PaintBlock(Vector2 mousePos) {
    for (int x = 0; x < brushWidth; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y < brushHeight; y++) {
            Vector2 offset = new Vector2(x, y);
            Vector2 worldPos = mousePos + offset;
            // Instantiate block at worldPos
        }
    }
}
I can guide you on updating the Editor script too if you want.

üî• 3. Particle Fire Thrust Issues
If your thrust particles sometimes don‚Äôt show:

Double-check your Particle System‚Äôs emission module is enabled.

Make sure your PlayerController actually calls thrustParticles.Play() on each press.

Add a short cooldown so it doesn't toggle off between frames.

Ensure it‚Äôs not behind other sprites or being culled by the camera.

‚úÖ In Scene View, select the ship and press Play ‚Äî watch whether the particles are playing or trying to and not rendering.

üß≠ 4. Add Landmarks or Background Grids
If you‚Äôre flying long distances with no reference:

Add simple parallax background layers or tiled backdrops.

Use repeating grid patterns or colored sectors.

Add a ‚Äúbeacon‚Äù prefab or lights every 10 units as landmarks.

Would you like help writing the larger brush tool now or adding the destructible terrain next?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement these improvements. Let's start by examining the current code and then make the necessary changes. First, I'll look at the relevant files.

Let me check the current camera follow script and block brush implementation:

Read file: /Users/johndowds/repos/PixelThrust/Assets/Scripts/CameraFollow.cs

---

Read file: /Users/johndowds/repos/PixelThrust/Assets/Scripts/BlockBrush.cs

---

Let's implement these improvements one by one. I'll start with updating the camera follow script to include bounds, then enhance the block brush tool.

1. First, let's update the CameraFollow script to include bounds:


---

```diff
      public float smoothSpeed = 0.05f;
      public Vector3 offset;        // Optional offset if needed
- 
+     
+     [Header("Camera Bounds")]
+     public Vector2 minCamPos = new Vector2(-25f, -15f);  // Default bounds for 50x30 level
+     public Vector2 maxCamPos = new Vector2(25f, 15f);
+     public bool useBounds = true;
+ 
      void LateUpdate()
      {
```

```diff
          Vector3 desiredPosition = target.position + offset;
          Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, smoothSpeed);
-         transform.position = new Vector3(smoothedPosition.x, smoothedPosition.y, transform.position.z); // Keep original Z
+         
+         if (useBounds)
+         {
+             smoothedPosition.x = Mathf.Clamp(smoothedPosition.x, minCamPos.x, maxCamPos.x);
+             smoothedPosition.y = Mathf.Clamp(smoothedPosition.y, minCamPos.y, maxCamPos.y);
+         }
+         
+         transform.position = new Vector3(smoothedPosition.x, smoothedPosition.y, transform.position.z);
      }
  }
```

2. Now, let's enhance the BlockBrush script to support a larger brush size and drag-to-paint functionality:


---

```diff
  {
      public GameObject blockPrefab;
+     
+     [Header("Brush Settings")]
+     public int brushWidth = 1;
+     public int brushHeight = 1;
+     public bool isDragging = false;
+     public bool eraseMode = false;
+     
+     private Vector2 lastPaintPosition;
+     private float minDragDistance = 0.1f; // Minimum distance between paint points
+     
+     void Update()
+     {
+         if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
+         {
+             isDragging = true;
+             PaintAtMousePosition();
+         }
+         else if (Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0))
+         {
+             isDragging = false;
+         }
+         
+         if (isDragging)
+         {
+             Vector2 currentMousePos = GetMouseWorldPosition();
+             if (Vector2.Distance(currentMousePos, lastPaintPosition) >= minDragDistance)
+             {
+                 PaintAtMousePosition();
+             }
+         }
+         
+         // Toggle erase mode with E key
+         if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E))
+         {
+             eraseMode = !eraseMode;
+             Debug.Log("Erase mode: " + eraseMode);
+         }
+     }
+     
+     void PaintAtMousePosition()
+     {
+         Vector2 mousePos = GetMouseWorldPosition();
+         lastPaintPosition = mousePos;
+         
+         for (int x = 0; x < brushWidth; x++)
+         {
+             for (int y = 0; y < brushHeight; y++)
+             {
+                 Vector2 offset = new Vector2(x, y);
+                 Vector2 worldPos = mousePos + offset;
+                 
+                 if (eraseMode)
+                 {
+                     // Find and destroy any blocks at this position
+                     Collider2D[] colliders = Physics2D.OverlapPointAll(worldPos);
+                     foreach (Collider2D collider in colliders)
+                     {
+                         if (collider.gameObject.CompareTag("Destructible"))
+                         {
+                             Destroy(collider.gameObject);
+                         }
+                     }
+                 }
+                 else
+                 {
+                     // Check if there's already a block here
+                     if (!Physics2D.OverlapPoint(worldPos))
+                     {
+                         Instantiate(blockPrefab, worldPos, Quaternion.identity);
+                     }
+                 }
+             }
+         }
+     }
+     
+     Vector2 GetMouseWorldPosition()
+     {
+         Vector3 mousePos = Input.mousePosition;
+         mousePos.z = -Camera.main.transform.position.z;
+         return Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(mousePos);
+     }
  }
  
```

I've implemented both major improvements:

1. **Camera Follow with Bounds**:
- Added configurable camera bounds with default values for a 50x30 level
- Added a toggle to enable/disable bounds
- Improved the smoothing behavior while respecting bounds
- You can adjust the bounds in the Unity Inspector

2. **Enhanced Block Brush**:
- Added support for brush width and height
- Implemented drag-to-paint functionality
- Added an erase mode (toggle with 'E' key)
- Added collision checking to prevent overlapping blocks
- Added minimum drag distance to prevent too many blocks from being placed
- Added support for erasing blocks (they must be tagged as "Destructible")

To use these new features:

1. For the camera:
   - Select your main camera in the Unity Inspector
   - Adjust the `minCamPos` and `maxCamPos` values to match your level size
   - Toggle `useBounds` on/off as needed

2. For the block brush:
   - Select your brush tool in the Unity Inspector
   - Adjust `brushWidth` and `brushHeight` to change the brush size
   - Click and drag to paint blocks
   - Press 'E' to toggle between paint and erase modes
   - Make sure your destructible blocks are tagged with "Destructible"

Would you like me to help you with any of the other suggestions, such as:
1. Adding particle effects for the thrust
2. Implementing background grids or landmarks
3. Creating level boundaries with invisible walls

Let me know which aspect you'd like to tackle next!

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement the remaining suggestions. Let's start with adding level boundaries and then work on the particle effects for thrust.

First, let's create a new script for level boundaries:


---

```diff
- 
+ using UnityEngine;
+ 
+ public class LevelBoundary : MonoBehaviour
+ {
+     [Header("Boundary Settings")]
+     public float width = 50f;  // Total width of the level
+     public float height = 30f; // Total height of the level
+     public float wallThickness = 1f;
+     public Color gizmoColor = new Color(1f, 0f, 0f, 0.3f);
+ 
+     private void Start()
+     {
+         CreateBoundaries();
+     }
+ 
+     private void CreateBoundaries()
+     {
+         // Create walls
+         CreateWall("LeftWall", new Vector2(-width/2 - wallThickness/2, 0), new Vector2(wallThickness, height + wallThickness));
+         CreateWall("RightWall", new Vector2(width/2 + wallThickness/2, 0), new Vector2(wallThickness, height + wallThickness));
+         CreateWall("TopWall", new Vector2(0, height/2 + wallThickness/2), new Vector2(width + wallThickness, wallThickness));
+         CreateWall("BottomWall", new Vector2(0, -height/2 - wallThickness/2), new Vector2(width + wallThickness, wallThickness));
+     }
+ 
+     private void CreateWall(string name, Vector2 position, Vector2 size)
+     {
+         GameObject wall = new GameObject(name);
+         wall.transform.parent = transform;
+         wall.transform.position = position;
+ 
+         BoxCollider2D collider = wall.AddComponent<BoxCollider2D>();
+         collider.size = size;
+     }
+ 
+     private void OnDrawGizmos()
+     {
+         // Draw the level boundaries in the editor
+         Gizmos.color = gizmoColor;
+         Gizmos.DrawWireCube(transform.position, new Vector3(width, height, 0));
+     }
+ } 
```

Now, let's check the current PlayerController to see how we can improve the thrust particles:

Read file: /Users/johndowds/repos/PixelThrust/Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs

---

Let's enhance the PlayerController with better particle handling and add a background grid system:


---

```diff
      public ParticleSystem thrustEffect;
      public AudioSource thrustAudio;
+     public float particleCooldown = 0.1f; // Minimum time between particle toggles
+     private float lastParticleToggle;
  
      void Start()
      {
          currentFuel = maxFuel;
+         if (thrustEffect)
+         {
+             var emission = thrustEffect.emission;
+             emission.enabled = false;
+         }
      }
  
```

```diff
              currentFuel -= fuelConsumptionRate * Time.deltaTime;
  
-             // Play effects
-             if (thrustEffect && !thrustEffect.isPlaying)
-                 thrustEffect.Play();
+             // Play effects with cooldown
+             if (thrustEffect && Time.time - lastParticleToggle >= particleCooldown)
+             {
+                 var emission = thrustEffect.emission;
+                 emission.enabled = true;
+                 if (!thrustEffect.isPlaying)
+                     thrustEffect.Play();
+                 lastParticleToggle = Time.time;
+             }
+             
              if (thrustAudio && !thrustAudio.isPlaying)
                  thrustAudio.Play();
```

```diff
          {
              // Stop effects
-             if (thrustEffect && thrustEffect.isPlaying)
-                 thrustEffect.Stop();
+             if (thrustEffect)
+             {
+                 var emission = thrustEffect.emission;
+                 emission.enabled = false;
+             }
              if (thrustAudio && thrustAudio.isPlaying)
                  thrustAudio.Stop();
```

Now, let's create a background grid system to help with spatial awareness:


---

```diff
- 
+ using UnityEngine;
+ 
+ public class BackgroundGrid : MonoBehaviour
+ {
+     [Header("Grid Settings")]
+     public float gridSize = 10f;        // Size of each grid cell
+     public float lineWidth = 0.05f;     // Width of grid lines
+     public Color gridColor = new Color(1f, 1f, 1f, 0.1f);
+     public Color majorLineColor = new Color(1f, 1f, 1f, 0.2f);
+     public int majorLineInterval = 5;   // Every Nth line is a major line
+ 
+     [Header("Landmarks")]
+     public bool showLandmarks = true;
+     public float landmarkInterval = 50f;
+     public Color landmarkColor = new Color(1f, 0.5f, 0f, 0.3f);
+     public float landmarkSize = 1f;
+ 
+     private void OnDrawGizmos()
+     {
+         if (!Application.isPlaying)
+         {
+             DrawGrid();
+             if (showLandmarks)
+                 DrawLandmarks();
+         }
+     }
+ 
+     private void DrawGrid()
+     {
+         // Get the camera's view bounds
+         Camera cam = Camera.main;
+         if (cam == null) return;
+ 
+         float height = 2f * cam.orthographicSize;
+         float width = height * cam.aspect;
+ 
+         Vector3 camPos = cam.transform.position;
+         float startX = Mathf.Floor((camPos.x - width/2) / gridSize) * gridSize;
+         float startY = Mathf.Floor((camPos.y - height/2) / gridSize) * gridSize;
+         float endX = Mathf.Ceil((camPos.x + width/2) / gridSize) * gridSize;
+         float endY = Mathf.Ceil((camPos.y + height/2) / gridSize) * gridSize;
+ 
+         // Draw vertical lines
+         for (float x = startX; x <= endX; x += gridSize)
+         {
+             bool isMajorLine = Mathf.Abs(x % (gridSize * majorLineInterval)) < 0.01f;
+             Gizmos.color = isMajorLine ? majorLineColor : gridColor;
+             Gizmos.DrawLine(new Vector3(x, startY, 0), new Vector3(x, endY, 0));
+         }
+ 
+         // Draw horizontal lines
+         for (float y = startY; y <= endY; y += gridSize)
+         {
+             bool isMajorLine = Mathf.Abs(y % (gridSize * majorLineInterval)) < 0.01f;
+             Gizmos.color = isMajorLine ? majorLineColor : gridColor;
+             Gizmos.DrawLine(new Vector3(startX, y, 0), new Vector3(endX, y, 0));
+         }
+     }
+ 
+     private void DrawLandmarks()
+     {
+         Camera cam = Camera.main;
+         if (cam == null) return;
+ 
+         float height = 2f * cam.orthographicSize;
+         float width = height * cam.aspect;
+ 
+         Vector3 camPos = cam.transform.position;
+         float startX = Mathf.Floor((camPos.x - width/2) / landmarkInterval) * landmarkInterval;
+         float startY = Mathf.Floor((camPos.y - height/2) / landmarkInterval) * landmarkInterval;
+         float endX = Mathf.Ceil((camPos.x + width/2) / landmarkInterval) * landmarkInterval;
+         float endY = Mathf.Ceil((camPos.y + height/2) / landmarkInterval) * landmarkInterval;
+ 
+         Gizmos.color = landmarkColor;
+ 
+         for (float x = startX; x <= endX; x += landmarkInterval)
+         {
+             for (float y = startY; y <= endY; y += landmarkInterval)
+             {
+                 Vector3 pos = new Vector3(x, y, 0);
+                 Gizmos.DrawWireSphere(pos, landmarkSize);
+             }
+         }
+     }
+ } 
```

I've implemented all the suggested improvements:

1. **Level Boundaries**:
- Created a new `LevelBoundary` script that creates invisible walls
- Configurable width and height (default 50x30 units)
- Visual gizmos in the editor to see the boundaries
- Automatically creates colliders for the walls

2. **Improved Thrust Particles**:
- Added a cooldown system to prevent rapid toggling
- Better particle emission control using the emission module
- Proper initialization of particle systems
- More reliable particle toggling

3. **Background Grid System**:
- Created a new `BackgroundGrid` script
- Configurable grid size and colors
- Major grid lines for better orientation
- Optional landmarks at regular intervals
- Grid automatically adjusts to camera view
- Only visible in the editor (won't affect gameplay)

To set this up in your Unity scene:

1. For the level boundaries:
   - Create an empty GameObject named "LevelBoundary"
   - Attach the `LevelBoundary` script
   - Adjust the width and height to match your level size

2. For the background grid:
   - Create an empty GameObject named "BackgroundGrid"
   - Attach the `BackgroundGrid` script
   - Adjust the grid size and colors to your liking
   - Enable/disable landmarks as needed

3. For the thrust particles:
   - The improvements are already in the PlayerController
   - Make sure your particle system is properly set up in the Unity Inspector
   - Adjust the `particleCooldown` value if needed

Would you like me to help you with any specific adjustments to these systems or explain any part in more detail?
